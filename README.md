# GitHub Actions Workshop

Welcome to the GitHub Actions workshop!
This workshop will teach you how to use GitHub Actions to automate your workflows.

## What are GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions are a way to automate your workflows.
Anything that needs to be done _every time something happens_ it typically a job for machines.
GitHub Actions can trigger any time code changes, a pull request is opened, a new release is created, and more.
You can even add a button in the GitHub UI to trigger a workflow manually.

Typical use cases for GitHub Actions include:

- Running tests
- Building and deploying applications
- Sending notifications
- Creating releases
- Checking for security vulnerabilities

Ok, that's the introduction out of the way, let's get started!

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- A text editor (e.g. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

If you don't want to use a text editor, it's possible to do everything on <https://github.dev>, which essentially is a web-based version of Visual Studio Code.

## 0 Getting started

1. Fork this repository

If you're doing things locally:

2. Clone your forked repository
3. Open your new repository in your text editor

If you're doing things on <https://github.dev>:

2. Open your forked repository on <https://github.dev/[your-username]/gh-actions-workshop>

Now you're ready to go!
Please proceed to [task 1](tasks/1/README.md).
